# Technical Documentation Page (Free Code Camp)

This a project from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) to receive the Responsive Web Design Certification. The goal is to create a simple documentation page about a technology or a software with a menu to navigate through the page.

Here it is the model: https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks.

Here it is my version: https://codepen.io/italo9311/full/MWVwyWd. I used the text of [HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) of MDN.
